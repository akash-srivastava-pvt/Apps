# Apps

Apps is a curated collection of applications built by me, primarily using open-source technologies and modern Java and JavaScript ecosystems. These projects explore practical, real-world problem solving while thoughtfully integrating AI where it adds meaningful value. Each app reflects a focus on learning, experimentation, and building scalable, developer-friendly solutions.

## App 1: GemSuite 💎

**The Intelligence Laboratory of Connected AI Assistants**

Gem Suite is a premium, production-ready desktop ecosystem designed to bring the advanced reasoning capabilities of the **Gemini 3** ecosystem directly into everyday workflows. Rather than being a single-purpose app, Gem Suite is a high-performance **extensible AI framework** that hosts a growing collection of focused, purpose-built “Gem” applications—each designed to solve a specific class of problems deeply and intuitively.
